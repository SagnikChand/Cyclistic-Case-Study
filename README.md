# Cyclistic Bike Share Capstone Case Study
Completing the Google Data Analytics certificate was a significant achievement, culminating in the Cyclistic bike-share capstone project. Throughout this project, I utilized a combination of Excel, SQL, and R to manipulate data and derive valuable analytical insights aimed at enhancing the company's performance. My data wrangling skills were put to the test as I worked with diverse datasets, ensuring accuracy and relevance in my analysis. Leveraging effective visualization techniques in Tableau, I presented compelling findings that shed light on various aspects of the business, particularly in advertising strategies and expense management, ultimately aiming to improve user engagement and overall operational efficiency.
